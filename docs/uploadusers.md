1. Download the Excel template file <a href="NetbooksUserImport.xlsx" download>here</a>.
2. Before starting, make a copy of the file.
3. Open your file.
4. Paste or insert your data into the three columns - First Name, Last Name and School Year/Class - the spreadsheet should work for either.
5. Drag down and auto-fill the School Code, Initials and Username columns.
6. You'll notice some usernames are red. These are duplicates.
7. To fix this, got to the row of one of the duplicates and insert an 'A' into the Suffix column.
8. Repeat this for each duplicate.
9. After all duplicates are sorted, go to File, and Save As.
10. Make sure to select '.csv' as the saved file type.
11. Choose a location for the file, and click 'Save' - if any popups show, just click 'OK'.
12. Go to [netbooks.org.uk/users](https://netbooks.org.uk/users)
13. Click Yes, and select your file.
14. Check over all data and make sure all fields are correct.
15. There's also an option to overwrite users with the same username - this is recommended.
16. When you're ready, just click Upload to import your users!
